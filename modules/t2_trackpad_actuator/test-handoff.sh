# Temporarily hand the T2 actuator HID interface from t2hid to
# t2_trackpad_actuator, then restore it unconditionally after DURATION
# seconds (default 10, override with the DURATION env var). Keep this
# bounded and automatic: see t2_precision_trackpad/test-handoff.sh for the
# prior incident that makes this non-negotiable.
#
# Unlike the trackpad handoff, this checks that the new driver binds to
# exactly one of the five sibling HID interfaces on the same composite USB
# device (the vendor usage-page/usage match in probe()), not the whole
# device. The other four are also checked to remain untouched.
